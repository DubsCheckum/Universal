# Welcome to the Universal 2.0 scripts!
You can set your configuration settings below.

For the best configuration experience, use a text editor with
syntax highlighting (Notepad++ for example, https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/).
Doing this will allow comments to be easily differentiated from code.

Note: Any lines prefixed with two hyphens, "--", are comments,
      this means that they have no effect on the code. These lines
      are just a description of the setting.

## Configuration Rules:
    • Alphabetical values MUST be enclosed in quotation marks (excluding true/false)
    • Numeric values MUST NOT be enclosed in quotation marks (excluding route/floor names)
